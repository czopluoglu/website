[itemanalysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/itemanalysis/index.html) is an R package I specifically compiled for an intro measurement class I teach. It is customized based on the content and concepts I cover in that class about Classical Test Theory Item Analysis. It has two simple functions to run classical test theory item analysis for multiple-choice test items and polytomous items (e.g., rating scales). It also provides empirical item trace lines. The statistics reported in this package can be found in any classic measurement textbook,

Please visit this page later as I plan to publish more documentation and tutorials about using this package.
