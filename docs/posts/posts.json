    "description": "A friend of mine, Dr. Abdullah Aydogan (https://twitter.com/abdaydgn), has asked me this morning if it is possible to pull the data for the 2019 local elections in Turkey. The only accessible information is through the Anadolu Agency (https://www.aa.com.tr/en) because the official election organization's website (http://www.ysk.gov.tr/) has not been working for a while. Here, I provide the code I used to scrap data from the Anadolu Agency, only available source for election results.",

    "description": "In one of the working papers under review, I am using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to identify examinees with potential item preknowledge in a certification exam. In the original paper, one of the reviewers asked more description of the XGBoost to help readers get a conceptual understanding of how XGBoost works. After spending a few weeks on the original paper, I finally felt that I had a good grasp of it. In this post, I provide an informal introduction of XGboost using an illustration with accompanying R code.",
