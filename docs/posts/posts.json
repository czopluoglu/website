    "description": "I pitched the idea of using Samejima's Continuous Response Model (CRM) to measure the Oral Reading Fluency (ORF) a while ago when I published a paper in 2012. In that paper, I used an ORF dataset from the Minneapolis Public Schools District (MPS) as a real data example. Since then, I don't think anybody has bought the idea of using CRM to measure ORF, so here I am trying one more time with some accessible R code.",

    "description": "A while ago, I compiled the election data for the 2019 mayoral elections in Turkey, which took place on March 31, 2019, through the Anadolu Agency website, only accessible information back then because the website for the Turkey's Higher Electoral Commission (YSK) was down and they did not make the official election data available until recently. This data was also limited as the Anadolu Agency only provided overall numbers (not for each ballot box). Now, it seems that YSK's website is alive back again and provides a nice-user friendly dashboard for the election data at the ballot box level. However, their dashboard is not very data-analyst friendly for those who has been starving for a more deeper analysis. Here, I provide the data and the R code I used to scrap this data from YSK's website.",

After spending a few weeks on the original paper, I finally felt that I had a good grasp of it. In this post, I provide an informal introduction of XGboost using an illustration with accompanying R code.",
