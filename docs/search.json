Before joining the EMPL faculty in 2020, I served seven years in the Research, Measurement, and Evaluation Program in the Department of Educational and Psychological Studies (EPS) at the University of Miami, specializing in educational measurement and statistics.\r\nI received my Ph.D. in Quantitative Methods in Education program from the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota. During my graduate education, I held research positions with the Quantitative Methods in Education program and Office of Research and Consultation Services at the University of Minnesota. I also completed my internships at the Minneapolis Public Schools in Minnesota and ACT, Inc. in Iowa. While anything related to computation and statistics attracts my attention, my primary research interests in the past decade were in three areas: item response theory, statistical detection of test fraud, and nonlinear mixed-effects models.\r\n\r\n\r\nI post blogs to develop and maintain a habit of writing and coding. I intend to blog about\r\nreproducible R code for my published papers,\r\ndocumentation about the R packages I have written,\r\nthings I learn as I read papers in my research areas,\r\nsome new ideas before I invest my time in writing a formal academic paper,\r\ntutorial type applications (in R) from courses I teach,\r\nany fancy implementation of R programming such as web scraping,\r\nand anything else that excites me about using R and my research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It is a compilation of functions I wrote when I was writing my master’s thesis in 2009 and doing my internship in ACT in 2012. It contains functions for several IRT and non-IRT based response similarity indices proposed in the literature for multiple-choice examinations such as the \\(\\omega\\) (Wollack, 1997), generalized binomial test (van der Linden & Sotaridona, 2006), K index and its variants (Sotaridona & Meijer,2002), and S1 and S2 indices (Sotaridona & Meijer, 2003), and M4 (Maynes, 2014)\r\nPlease visit this page later as I plan to publish some detailed documentation about the implementation of these indices in the CopyDetect package.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
