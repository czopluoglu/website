Before\r\njoining the University of Oregon faculty in 2020, I served seven years\r\nin the Research, Measurement, and Evaluation Program in the Department of Educational\r\nand Psychological Studies (EPS) at the University of Miami, specializing\r\nin educational measurement and statistics.\r\nI received my Ph.D. in Quantitative\r\nMethods in Education program from the Department of Educational\r\nPsychology at the University of Minnesota. During my graduate education,\r\nI held research positions with the Quantitative Methods in Education\r\nprogram and Office of Research and Consultation Services at the\r\nUniversity of Minnesota. I also completed my internships at the\r\nMinneapolis Public Schools in Minnesota and ACT, Inc. in Iowa. While\r\nanything related to computation and statistics attracts my attention, my\r\nprimary research interests in the past decade were in three areas: item\r\nresponse theory, statistical detection of test fraud, and nonlinear\r\nmixed-effects models.\r\n\r\n\r\nI post blogs to develop and maintain a habit of writing and coding. I\r\nintend to blog about\r\nreproducible R code for my published papers,\r\ndocumentation about the R packages I have written,\r\nthings I learn as I read papers in my research areas,\r\nsome new ideas before I invest my time in writing a formal academic\r\npaper,\r\ntutorial type applications (in R) from courses I teach,\r\nany fancy implementation of R programming such as web scraping,\r\nand anything else that excites me about using R and my\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
