This is a post to test how to embed external Shiny apps in html posts, and whether or not it works.

Below is a shiny app I developed long time ago. Enter names (with the first letter capitalized) and it will create a trend plot based on National Data on Given Names in the Population of U.S. Births from Social Security Administration Data You can change the y-axis maximum to zoom for rare names.
